# simple_bank_account

V1


In this first version we have working a docker enviroment. We have three principal commands for work with docker:

1.- docker-compose build will build all project, I recommend use it when some requirements.txt has been changed.
2.- docker-compose up will start server.

3.- docker-machine ip will be used only if you try to access to localhost:port and nothing is found, this command will show ip which are listening.
